gpu_cits_lag_cupc_faithful.py

Faithful scalable CITS-lag: matches the exact CITS algorithm
(cits.methods.cits_full with cond_dep='cond_dep_pcorr') on every axis EXCEPT
the conditioning-set search, which is replaced by the neighbor-restricted,
increasing-size PC search (cuPC on GPU). That single substitution is sound
under the faithfulness assumption CITS already requires: a valid separating
set is guaranteed to lie within the adjacency set, so the powerset traversal
is redundant and cuPC recovers the same skeleton under the oracle.

Matched to exact CITS (unlike the earlier gpu_cits_lag_cupc.py):
  - NON-overlapping windows (as in cits.methods.data_transform), not overlapping.
  - Window width w = 2*(tau+1) and time-major layout c = t*p + v
    (identical to data_transform / cits_unrolled indexing).
  - Full initial adjacency -> conditioning pool is the whole window, exactly
    as in the CITS powerset (which conditions on all window variables).
  - Targeted extraction of lag edges into the present slice t = 2*tau+1 from
    source slices t1 in {tau+1, ..., 2*tau}, oriented by time -- identical to
    cits_unrolled's tested edge set and cits_rolled's collapse.

Only remaining difference from cits_full(pcorr): powerset conditioning ->
neighbor-restricted increasing-size search (cuPC, capped at level 14).
